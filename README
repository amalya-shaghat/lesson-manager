## Technologies

## Installation

1. **Install WordPress**: Download and set up WordPress on a local or live server.
2. **Install Plugins**:
   - **Elementor**: Go to the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to `Plugins > Add New`, search for *Elementor*, and install it.
   - *(Optional)* **JetEngine**: This plugin simplifies creating custom post types. Install via `Plugins > Add New` if desired.

## Setup

### 1. Custom Post Type (CPT) - "Lessons"
   - Create a new custom post type called "Lessons" to manage individual lesson records.
   - You can use JetEngine, CPT UI, or add the code directly in `functions.php`.

### 2. Elementor Dashboard Layout
   - Create a new page (e.g., “Lesson Dashboard”) and design the layout in Elementor.
   - Add sections for:
     - **Progress Chart**
     - **Add Lesson Button**
     - **Lesson Cards Grid**

### 3. JavaScript and Modals
   - Use JavaScript to manage form modals for adding, editing, and deleting lessons.
   - AJAX will handle data submissions and updates.

### 4. Chart Integration
   - Use Chart.js or similar to visualize lesson completion rates.
   - Pull data dynamically from the "Lessons" CPT.

## Usage

- **Add Lessons**: Click the "Add Lesson" button to open a modal for adding new lessons.
- **Edit Lessons**: Each lesson card has an "Edit" button. Clicking it opens a modal to update lesson details.
- **Delete Lessons**: The "Delete" button opens a confirmation modal. Confirming deletion removes the lesson.

## Future Enhancements

- Additional fields for lesson description, instructor, duration, etc.
- More detailed analytics on lesson completion.
- User-specific dashboards.
